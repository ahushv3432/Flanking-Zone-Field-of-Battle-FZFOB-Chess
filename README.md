## Introduction

Chess has captivated minds for centuries. This variant aims to expand that engagement by introducing a new dimension to the game. The Flanking Zone allows knights to play a more pivotal role, adding layers of strategy and excitement. Players will need to think differently about positioning and movement, making each game a fresh challenge.

## Game Rules

The rules of **Flanking Zone Field of Battle Chess** closely follow traditional chess, with the following key differences:

1. **Board Layout**: The game is played on a 10×10 board. The outer two rows and columns form the Flanking Zone.
2. **Knight Movement**: Knights can move into the Flanking Zone at any time. Their ability to jump over pieces gives them an edge in controlling this area.
3. **Objective**: The goal remains to checkmate the opponent's king, but controlling the Flanking Zone can provide significant strategic advantages.

### Basic Setup

- Each player starts with the same pieces as in standard chess: 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, and 8 Pawns.
- The board is oriented with a light square in the bottom-right corner for each player.

### Special Rules

- Knights may not be captured while in the Flanking Zone unless the opponent has no other legal moves.
- Players must strategize around the Flanking Zone to maximize their knight's potential.
